# Dog-Breed-Classification
This project implements a deep learning-based dog breed classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub. The goal is to identify a dog's breed from an input image.

Problem:
The task involves recognizing a dog's breed from an image, useful for scenarios like identifying a dog's breed from a photo taken at a cafe.

Data:
The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle, consisting of labeled images of various dog breeds.

Evaluation:
The evaluation is based on predicting the probabilities for each dog breed in the test images. The evaluation metric aligns with the Dog Breed Identification challenge on Kaggle.

Features:
Key points about the data:

I am utilizing deep learning and transfer learning due to the nature of image data.
There are 120 different dog breeds, making this a multiclass classification problem.
The training set comprises over 10,000 labeled images.
The test set includes over 10,000 unlabeled images for prediction purposes. üê∂üéâ‚ú®
